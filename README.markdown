jQuery Reticulator
==================

Reticulator takes its name from the fancy [Fireworks extenison](http://sofanaranja.com/reticulator/) [(*)]() created by [Ale Muñoz](http://bomberstudios.com/). Now this extension is part of [OrangeCommands](http://bomberstudios.com/orangecommands).

I like the idea of the CSS frameworks like [YUI](http://developer.yahoo.com/yui/grids/), [blueprint](http://www.blueprintcss.org/), [960](http://960.gs/), the über complete [compass-style](http://compass-style.org/)... but in my real work I don't use this tools. With this plugin you can define your regular grid and use it like the Fireworks guides.
